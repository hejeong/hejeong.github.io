Initially, I wasn't sure why I decided to learn how to code. I had always enjoyed being on the computer, and I thought maybe it'd be cool to study computer engineering, because the computer had such a big impact on present day computing. But after finishing my 2nd year of university, I honestly felt like I haven't learned much. We learned about digital logic designs, principles of electrical circuits, and mathematical strategies. Yes, I'm learning about all this, but I currently do not have an idea of how I am supposed to apply any of this in the next chapter of my life after college.  

So, I extended my studies out to a little bit of computer science.
It's a completely different world over there. We were learning techniques, even more a greater comprehensive way of problem solving, that could be used anywhere. Essentially we were developing tools and strategies to create a program of purpose. 

What's most captivating about software development is that the possibilities are nearly unlimited. Think about how far technology has come today, and prospects for even greater technological advancements. Most of the things we use now are made possible by software, even web development. To see how much web development has grown since the 2000s is really fascinating. Now when I look at a website, I can really appreciate the intricacy behind how it works, and it really represents the fruit that a couple minds of software developers can achieve. Now, I'm aiming to be able to provide my own two cents in the web development world.
