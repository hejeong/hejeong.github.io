What a journey it has been! After many months, and a 3 month pause in between, I've finally made it. 
Honestly, if anyone is in my shoes, I wouldn't consider trying to manage a college engineering degree alongside a coding bootcamp; it's pretty stressful especially during exam weeks. But onto my project!

My final project was inspired by my experience with running. I ran in high school cross country and track, and had lots of fun running because it made me feel free. The competitive side of me brought out a fierce rivalry between my best friend and me, but I often times just ran for the exercise. Upon graduating high school and thus separating from my closest friends, I've lost the motivation to run on my own. Two years later, I often find myself longing for that feeling of running with the wind. In search of my passion to run again, I wish I could find a community online that talk about their own experiences with running, whether it be their practice regimens, or an account of things that make them motivated. Thus, RunnersWeekly was born. 

RunnersWeekly was written in React and Redux, with a Rails API Backend. Along the course of building this app, I've learned how to use JWT authentication, and found out how difficult using Material UI could be. Given my time constraints, I've stuck to using my own stylesheet to polish the look of my app. Honestly, working with React was really easy, and Rails API was familiar, but quite ambiguous in the beginning. I wondered how you would communicate between the two, but they really just communicate with AJAX requests that send or return json objects that contain the requested data or errors. The video guides by Howard were probably the best resource in learning how everything intertwines together, but a lot of the learning should be on your own. The amount of information I learned beyond the Learn curriculum is just as vast as the curriculum itself. That's the way programming is; you get as much from it as you put into it. 

RunnersWeekly was a great opportunity to showcase what I've learned, and get used to using Redux and Redux-Thunk middleware. I'm quite proud of what I've created, and it yields for future expansion and production when I have the time to come back to it. If you have the opportunity to check out my stuff, I'd love for you to try it out for yourself at https://github.com/hejeong/react-redux-app. I'll have a README up shortly, and please give me any feedback if you happen to read this! I'm thinking of writing a guide from what I've learned from this project, so be sure to keep up with my blog if you're interested! :) See you next time!
